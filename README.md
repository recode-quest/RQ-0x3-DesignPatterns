# 0x3 DESIGN PATTERNS

> Have you heard of design patterns? We hope so. And what about implementing many different ones within the same solution, yet still maintainable, without tight coupling any part of structure?

This time you'll have to make use of any design pattern, depending on your skills. It's up to you, whether you implement a structural, creational or behavioral one. Try creating at least one. If it's too easy, then manage to implement at least 2 different design patters within the same project/solution without tightly coupling architecture members.

## RULES

1. You can work alone or collaborate in a team.
2. Be honest. Try not to copy-paste other's solutions or chunks of libraries.
3. You are working on your own EXP aka portfolio.
4. You can use any technologies :)

## SOLUTIONS

Assuming you want to be listed here, you need to supply your solution until 20.03.2021 and comply with [regulations](https://github.com/recode-quest/REGULATIONS).
